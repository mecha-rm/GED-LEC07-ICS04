# GED-LEC07-ICS04
Repository for the fourth in-class exercise for Game Engines. This will involve the modification of an existing coding project.
The point of this project is to measure the CPU usage and memory usage before and after the optimization took place (i.e. the different between the two projects).
The completed assignment implemented the singleton bonus, but not the factory bonus.

GED-LEC07-01 is the original base code.
GED-LEC07-02 is the completed, optimized assignment code.
